# GPU Colocation

This is a OpenMP-based program to for parallel colocation mining [1,2]

### How to Compile

1. Install boost. (https://www.boost.org/users/download/) 
2. Change your current directory to be the directory containing main.cpp  and colocationFinder.cpp
3. In the console, compile with: **g++ -std=c++11 -fopenmp -I (boost_installation_path) main.cpp colocationFinder.cpp -o OpenMP-Colocation

### How to Run

1. We have a data folder for you to test out.
2. To run the compiled OpenMP-Colocation program: ./OpenMP-Colocation /home/TestCase/config.txt

### Input Data Description
1. Please see the Technical Document pdf file.
